/**
 * A Synchronizer that attempts to remain operational, despite any number of errors that can occur.
 * It acts as the glue that ties all the pieces of the SDK together. Each component of the SDK is
 * designed for the potential of stand-alone usage but coordinating all the interactions is non-
 * trivial. So the Synchronizer facilitates this, acting as reference that demonstrates how all the
 * pieces can be tied together. Its goal is to allow a developer to focus on their app rather than
 * the nuances of how Zcash works.
 *
 * @property ledger exposes flows of wallet transaction information.
 * @property manager manages and tracks outbound transactions.
 * @property processor saves the downloaded compact blocks to the cache and then scans those blocks for
